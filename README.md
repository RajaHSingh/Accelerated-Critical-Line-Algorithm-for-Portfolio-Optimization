# Accelerated-Critical-Line-Algorithm-for-Portfolio-Optimization 
Open Source Critical Line Algorithm with parallelized time intensive parts

This project was for Advanced Parallel Computing.  The project resulted in a GPU conference paper for IEEE.  It is
in the correction and submission phase of the process.  It has been written in latex and is available as pdf to read.

Folders:
gpu contains the parallelized parts of the code, more precisely the Cuda kernels that optimize the code
original_code_by_authors	contains the open source code written by Prado and Bailey
seq	uploaded all data and code contains the sequential algorithm after I altered it slightly
gpu_optimized_cla.pdf -the latex paper (IEEE format)

Each of the folders contains the data so each part can be tested independently
